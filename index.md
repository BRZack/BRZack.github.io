I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Connecticut, working under the supervision of [Vasilis Chousionis](https://www2.math.uconn.edu/~chousionis/). I study harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory in the context of sub-Riemannian geometry. The problems I am most interested in revolve around the theory of removable sets in Carnot groups and understanding how these sets can be related to the proper type of capacity.
